# ozp-webtop

Next Gen OZONE Webtop UI

## Prerequisites
Install Node.js and npm. Head over to [the Node.js website](http://nodejs.org/)
if you need to do that.
Next, install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) with
the command below.

    (sudo) npm install -g bower grunt-cli

## Getting Started
First clone the repo. Then install development dependencies with npm. Install
frontend app dependencies with Bower:

    cd ozp-webtop
    npm install && bower install
    
## Getting Webtop to run Locally
It cannot be run with Sudo (locally)

1. Have installed:
    `nvm 5.3.0`
    `npm 3.3.12`
    `gulp 3.9.0`
    `node 5.3.0`
2. bower
    - If you run `which bower` and it returns something move on to step 3.
    - Otherwise: go into `.npmrc` and change it to `prefix = ${HOME}/npm-global`
        - installing bower with `npm install -g bower` it should go to your home directory (if it works, delete it). 
        - Set your path variable to `${HOME}/npm-global/bin`
    - now isntall with `(sudo) npm install -g bower grunt-cli` in npm 5.3.0 (use `nvm use 5.3.0`)
    - Also may need to run `sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.npm ` and `sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.config ` if not owned by current user. may need to do for the /tmp/user folder as well
3. Run `npm install && bower install`
4. go into `/ozp-webtop/src/OzoneConfig.js` and change the API_URL to `http://localhost:8001`
5. Run grunt serve
    - If there is an enospc error, you may need to run `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`
    
    

## Grunt Tasks
Development tasks are run with Grunt:

 - `grunt` - run all tests, build, and create production version
 - `grunt serve`
     * Launch Webtop locally (see Important Links section below)
 - `grunt build` - build and execute unit tests
 - `grunt release:type` and `git push --tags` to create a patch, minor, or
 major release (updates changelog, versions, and creates tag)
 - `grunt run` - serve the production version of the application

Run `grunt -h` for a full list of Grunt tasks

## Important Links
* [local](http://localhost:9100)

## Use of IWC
By default, IWC is used to to retrieve the application information
(`system.api`) and to store the dashboard data (`data.api`). To check on the
 status of IWC, marketplace, and the backend, as well as to reset the
 data, use the [OZP Data Utility](http://ozoneplatform.github.io/ozp-webtop/tools/ozpDataUtility/index.html)

## Use of ng-boilerplate
This app was created from the
[ng-boilerplate template](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp).
See ngbp for details describing the directory layout, gruntfile, and testing
structure

## Responsive Design
Currently, Webtop is semi-responsive, supporting devices >= 768px ('small'
devices, as defined by Bootstrap)
